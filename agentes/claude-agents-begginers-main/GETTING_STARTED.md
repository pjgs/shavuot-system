# Getting Started with Claude Agents for Beginners 🚀

Welcome! This guide will take you from zero to having your first working Claude agent in just a few simple steps. No technical experience required!

## What You'll Build

## The 4-Step Journey

We've created 4 friendly agents that guide you through the entire process:

### 🔵 Step 1: Agent Idea Guide
**What it does**: Helps you discover and refine your agent idea
**Time needed**: 10-15 minutes
**You'll get**: A clear, specific concept for your agent

**Start by saying**: "I want to build an agent but I'm not sure what exactly" or describe any rough idea you have.

### 🟢 Step 2: Agent Builder  
**What it does**: Builds your agent based on your refined idea
**Time needed**: 15-20 minutes  
**You'll get**: A complete, working agent file

**Start by saying**: "I have my agent idea defined and I'm ready to build it"

### 🟠 Step 3: Agent Installer
**What it does**: Automatically installs your agent in Claude Code
**Time needed**: 2-3 minutes
**You'll get**: Your agent ready to use

**Start by saying**: "My agent is built and I need it installed"

### 🟣 Step 4: Agent Tester
**What it does**: Guides you through testing and optimizing your agent
**Time needed**: 10-15 minutes
**You'll get**: A validated, optimized agent

**Start by saying**: "My agent is installed and I want to test it"

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Copy the guided agents** to your Claude agents folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
   cp guided-agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

2. **Start a conversation** with Claude Code and say:
   "I want to use the agent-idea-guide to create my first agent"

3. **Follow the guided process** - each agent will hand you off to the next one

4. **Enjoy your new agent!** 🎉
